## [Unreleased]
### Security
### Added
### Fixed
- Corrected broken cross-reference in github-workflows.instructions.md — anchor #visual-indicators updated to #output-helpers to match actual section name in shell-scripts.instructions.md
- shell.firewall.examples.md open_port_for_private_networks no longer calls firewall-cmd --reload internally; added explicit caller-reload rule to shell.firewall.instructions.md
### Changed
- die() must output to stderr so error messages are not swallowed by stdout pipelines
- SDK - Updated DotNet SDK to 10.0.300
### Deprecated
### Removed

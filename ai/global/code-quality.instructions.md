# Code Quality Instructions

[Back to Global Instructions Index](index.md)

## Code Coverage

- 100% code coverage must be maintained by tests.
- How tests are organised in non-.NET projects should be detailed in the local AI instructions for each repository.

## Pre-Commit

- Unit tests must be written and must pass before every commit.
- Never commit code that causes existing tests to fail.

## Dead Code

- If code cannot be reached by any code path (dead code), remove it rather than writing tests around it.

## Immutability

- Code should prefer immutable objects wherever possible.
- Immutability is especially important in asynchronous and multi-threaded code, where mutable shared state is a common source of bugs.
- This rule may only be broken for performance reasons, and only when explicitly requested — any such exception should be noted in a comment explaining why mutability was necessary.

## Test Quality

- Tests must be held to the same code quality standards as production code — they are not exempt from readability, maintainability, or refactoring rules.
- Tests must not be brittle — they should test behaviour, not implementation details, so that refactoring production code does not unnecessarily break tests.
- Avoid hardcoding values or assumptions that are likely to change; use constants, builders, or factory helpers where appropriate.

## Refactoring

- After code is written and tested, review it to determine whether refactoring is needed.
- Refactoring must be done in a separate commit from the original code and test changes — never mix refactoring with feature or fix work.
- Tests must continue to pass after any refactoring commit.

## Compile-Time Configuration (e.g. environment-specific constants, feature flags resolved at build time) must be covered by a unit test rather than verified with a runtime check.
- This keeps production code clean and free of defensive assertions that only exist for testing purposes.
